# Announcement

Happy New Years, 2025.

As usual, I abandoned this project because of lack of motivation.
My resolution this time is to actually finish a project for once, so I'll put most of my free time (if it doesn't involve gaming) to updating this project and re-learning dart.

I have learnt a lot of new skills and tools since then from work, so expect smoother progress.

# Flutter Notepad

There is no official name for this mobile app.
The purpose of the mobile app is an open source notepad application that stores notes locally on-device (without using any APIs) and supports encryption by locking specific notes, a group of notes and etc.

The original purpose of this project is to create a fully-featured notes with at least an okay UI/UX for personal use and also a gateway for me to learn Flutter.

# TODO

## Important
- [X] Fix breaking changes
- [X] Upgrade libraries
- [ ] Find a suitable replacement for abandoned/unmaintained libraries (if any)
- [ ] Rewrite part of the codebase to use Dart's new features (if any)

## Features
- [X] Create notes
- [X] View notes
- [X] Edit notes
- [X] Delete notes
- [ ] Sort notes
- [ ] Archive notes
- [ ] Categorize notes (unlocked/open, locked, open group, locked group, archived)
- [ ] Data Encryption
- [X] Data Persistence
- [ ] UI Design & UX Improvements

# Planned Features
* Let users set "reminder alarms" to notes (maybe useful? but normal alarms can also achieve the same thing)
* Switch between typing or drawing on notes
* Choose encryption type (?)
* Labeling features (bookmark, color labels, creating a page to store notes, etc.)
