# Flutter Notepad

There is no official name for this mobile app.
The purpose of the mobile app is an open source notepad application that stores notes locally on-device (without using any APIs) and supports encryption by locking specific notes, a group of notes and etc.

The original purpose of this project is to create a fully-featured notes with at least an okay UI/UX for personal use and also a gateway for me to learn Flutter.
